            If you purchase real estate in Turkey that is worth at least
            $400,000 USD, you can apply for Turkish Citizenship by Investment

          <strong>
            Along your application, your spouse and any children under the age

          In June 2022, the government announced changes to their Turkish
          Citizenship by Investment Programme, sometimes called Turkey Golden
          Visa. These changes mean that buyers can obtain citizenship and a
          passport from as little as $400,000 USD. This has made the programme
          one of the most affordable and attractive citizenship initiatives
          around the world. Since then, thousands of investors have obtained
          citizenship through purchasing real estate, with Property Turkey
          helping many.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who are successful in their application, will have Turkish
          citizenship forever and any children born after will be born as
          citizens. Turkey allows dual nationality, allowing you to keep
          multiple citizenships alongside your Turkish one.

          <strong>Why invest in Turkey?</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Amazing climate</strong> – A lot of Turkish cities offer 300+
          days of sunny weather. For example, investing in a property in Bodrum
          guarantees a lovely lifestyle of glitz, glamour, and weather.
          Investors in Antalya can enjoy beaches and skiing within the same day.
          British investors in Fethiye real estate can enjoy the world famous
          Blue Lagoon beach.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Strategic location</strong> – Turkey is strategically located
          between the East and West, affectively becoming the bridge between the
          two. Because of this, Turkey offers unique opportunities in business
          as well as visa-free travel. Investors in Istanbul real estate can
          enjoy a gateway of accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ideal for families</strong> – Those who move to Turkey with
          families often comment on how hospitable and friendly Turks are.
          Turkey is a welcoming country towards foreigners and expats with some
          of the best international schools around.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Healthcare in Turkey</strong> – Rising as one of the world’s
          leading healthcare destinations and medical tourism, Turkey offers
          healthcare that is second to none – and extremely affordable when
          compared to other countries around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Food in Turkey</strong> – Need we say more. Turkish food is
          renowned globally for its unique tastes and rich ingredients. From
          fresh vegetables daily to classic kebabs and desserts, food in Turkey
          is delight in its own right.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Excellent value</strong> – With the depreciation of the
          Turkish Lira, the time to buy real estate in Turkey is right now,
          before prices rise. Invest in Turkey and you can pick up a villa to
          meet the $400,000 USD requirement in certain cities or a city centre
          apartment rising in Istanbul.
        </p>

          <strong>How long does it take to obtain Turkish Citizenship?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          In Property Turkey’s experience, it normally takes between 2 – 4
          months to complete the process for our clients to obtain Turkish
          Citizenship by Investment program. This process is a lot quicker than
          other countries around the globe which can take years.

        <h3>
          <strong>Can my children and dependents obtain citizenship?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yes. If you purchase a property worth $400,000 USD, you can obtain
          citizenship and a Turkish passport for yourself, your spouse, and
          children under 18 years of age. Any kids that are over 18 will need to
          purchase real estate in their own name worth $400,000 USD.

          <strong>
            After I have Turkish Citizenship and passport, do I need to live in
            Turkey?
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          No. You do not need to live in Turkey in order to keep your
          citizenship and passport. There are no minimum required days per year
          that you have to stay in Turkey. Your Citizenship is yours for life.

            Do I have to give up my birth citizenship in order to become a
            Turkish citizen?
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          No. You do not have to give up the citizenship of your birth in order
          to become a Turkish citizen because Turkey allows its citizens to keep
          dual nationality and passports.

        <h3>
          <strong>Will my Turkish Citizenship expire at some point?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Your citizenship will never expire. Once you have completed the
          process and held your property for a minimum of three years, your
          citizenship is guaranteed forever. This is the same for your spouse
          and any children include within your application.

        <h3>
          <strong>Do I need to learn Turkish to get a Turkish passport?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          While other citizenship programs and countries require you to pass a
          language test in order to obtain a passport, Turkey does not. You do
          not need to learn Turkish in order to apply for a passport. However,
          if you choose to live in Turkey permanently, it is highly recommended
          to learn the basics of the language in order to easily integrate into
          life within the country.

          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Having a Turkish passport provides visa-free access to more than 100
          countries around the world. These countries include: Japan, South
          Korea, South America, and more. Someone with a Turkish passport can
          also travel relatively easily to the USA, United Kingdom, Canada,
          Australia, and European Union countries. <strong>NOTE</strong>: A
          Turkish passport is renewable every ten years.

          <strong>Relocating to the UK or USA</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          As a Turkish national, you can apply for a Business Person visa to
          live and eventually obtain British citizenship. You can also apply for
          the E-2 Investor Visa to help relocate to the USA. If you dream of
          living in the UK or USA, Turkish Citizenship can be the gateway.

            Do I need to declare my wealth to Turkish authorities?
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          No. Turkish tax authorities will not ask you any questions regarding
          your current financial status or existing assets.

        <h3>
          <strong>Are there tax implications I should know about?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          As of 2022, Turkey has double taxation agreements with most countries
          throughout the developed world. Therefore, if you have paid taxes on
          your income earned from outside of Turkey, it is unlikely that you
          will be taxed again by the Turkish government. For more information,
          contact us to speak with a Turkish tax expert.

          <strong>
            Are there any nationals who cannot apply for Turkish Citizenship?
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Under current Turkish law, there are citizens of certain countries
          that are prohibited from applying for Turkish Citizenship by
          Investment. Presently, these are nationals of the following countries:
          Armenia, Cuba, North Korea, and Syria.

        <h3>
          <strong>Can I work in Turkey if my application is successful?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Those who apply for citizenship and obtain it, are then free to
          work in Turkey without the need of a work permit. Citizenship makes it
          easier to work in Turkey.

        <h3>
          <strong>Do I need to undertake Military Service?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          No. Applicants who have invested in Turkey and obtained their
          citizenship are exempt from mandatory military service. This also
          includes your dependents who have applied alongside you.
        </p>

          <strong>What are the inheritance laws of Turkey?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Turkish law fully protects its citizens and legal heirs in the
          unfortunate event of a death. Under Turkish law, your property and
          investment will smoothly pass down to your loved ones without much red
          tape.

          <strong>Can I pay using a currency that is not Turkish Lira?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>UPDATE</strong>: As of January 2022, buyers can no longer
          deposit money straight into the account of the seller. Instead,
          foreign buyers are now required to send their funds to a Turkish bank
          prior to purchasing a property. The bank will then exchange the
          currency via Turkey's Central Bank rate into Turkish Liras for the
          purchase.
